Instructions-:
First of all I created index.php file under which I have a navbar, body section and footer section. The navbar has signup and login button on the left side. When the user signs up and logins. He will see his username logout button and the button to go to dashboard. Now under the dashboard the user can create his own post, can view the post, can edit the post and can delete the post. Now let's talk about the body section, under the body section there will be only the posts made by the user which can be seen by any user.
